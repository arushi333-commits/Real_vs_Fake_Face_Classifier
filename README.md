# Real_vs_Fake_Face_Classifier
Real vs. Fake Face Classification with FastAPI
This project demonstrates how to build and deploy a deep learning model to classify images of faces as either "real" or "fake". The model is trained on a dataset of real and synthetically generated faces and then exposed as a web API using FastAPI and ngrok.

Project Overview
The main goal of this project is to create a reliable classifier for distinguishing between real human faces and those generated by AI (e.g., StyleGAN). The process involves:

Data Preparation: Downloading and preparing the "140k Real and Fake Faces" dataset from Kaggle.
Model Training: Training two different models: a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a pre-trained ResNet-18 model using transfer learning.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating the performance of the trained models using various metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and a confusion matrix.
API Deployment: Exposing the trained model as a web API using FastAPI, allowing for real-time predictions.
Public Access: Using ngrok to create a public URL for the API, making it accessible from anywhere.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
A Kaggle account and API token
An ngrok account and authentication token
Installation
The necessary Python libraries can be installed by running the first cell of the notebook:

ngrok Authentication
I have included my own ngrok authentication token in the notebook, so the API can be run without any additional setup.
